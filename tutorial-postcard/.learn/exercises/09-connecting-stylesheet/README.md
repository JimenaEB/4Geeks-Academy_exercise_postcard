## `09` Connecting your styles

In the styles.css file we have specified that we want the `body` of your website to be black.

Lets connect our `styles.css` with our `index.html` using a `<link>` tag.

Link tags are the only way to connect CSS Stylesheets with HTML files.

## üìù Instructions

Add the following code anywere inside the opening and closing `<head></head>` tags:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

Note: if the connection between CSS and HTML was successfull, your website should be **black** after you build.
