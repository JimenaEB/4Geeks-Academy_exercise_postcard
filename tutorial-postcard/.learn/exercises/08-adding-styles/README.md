## `08` Adding styles

If you build your website right now, you will see that it only says "Hello", the `div` we just added is invisible, lets change that.

To begin styling our website we must start by adding a `style.css` file that will contain all our website styling code.

## 📝 Instructions

- Create a `styles.css` file on the root of your project and add the following content to it:

```css
body{
    background: black;
}
```
