## üìù Instructions

 - Inside your `<div class="postcard">` add three additional divs, all three of them are immediate childs.

```txt
1. .postcard
    1.1. .postcard-header
    1.2. .postcard-body
    1.3. .postcard-footer
```

Please make sure the divs have the specified classes, the first of the 3 divs should have the class `postcard-header`, the second one `postcard-body` and the third one `postcard-footer`, you don't have to include the dot symbol in your class name, you will only use the dots in the CSS.
