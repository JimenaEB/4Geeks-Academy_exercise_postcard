## How should I start?

To start building you website you need to identify what are the tags needed for this particular website design. Take a look at this animation that shows you what tags should be used on this postcard:

## But how can you identify what tags to use?

Think about it like an Text document in Microsoft Word, there is an HTML `<tag>` for almost anything you can do in a text document: paragraphs, strong or italic text, headings, images, etc.

Memorize the 6 most important HTML tags and what they do: 

| tag                   | usage                 |
| -----------------     | --------------------- |
| `<p>`                 | for paragraphs        |
| `<button>`            | for buttons           |
| `<img>`               | for images            |
| `<h1>` `<h2>` `<h3>`  | titles (headings), `h1` is the biggest, h6 the smallest |
| `<div>`               | split your website in squares (boxes)  |
| `<input>`             | allows visitors to input information  |
